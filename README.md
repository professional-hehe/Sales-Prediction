# Project Overview
# Purpose
# This project implements a machine learning solution for predicting sales based on data spending across different media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper). It includes multiple optimization techniques and model evaluation methods to achieve the best possible predictions.
# Key Features
# •	Multiple regression algorithms implementation
# •	Automated feature engineering
# •	Hyperparameter optimization
# •	Comprehensive model evaluation
# •	Performance visualization
# •	Feature importance analysis
# Target Users
# •	Data Scientists
# •	Marketing Analysts
# •	Business Intelligence Teams
# •	Sales Forecasting Teams
# Installation & Setup
# Prerequisites
# •	Python 3.8 or higher
# •	pip (Python package manager)
# Required Libraries
# pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
# Data Requirements
# Input Data Format
# The input dataset should be a CSV file named ‘data.csv’ with the following columns: - TV: Data spending on TV (numerical) - Radio: Data spending on Radio (numerical) - Newspaper: Data spending on Newspaper (numerical) - Sales: Actual sales numbers (target variable, numerical)
# Data Format Example
# TV,Radio,Newspaper,Sales
# 230.1,37.8,69.2,22.1
# 44.5,39.3,45.1,10.4
# 17.2,45.9,69.3,9.3
# Data Quality Requirements
# •	No missing values
# •	Numerical values only
# •	Positive numbers for all columns
# •	Sufficient data points (minimum 100 recommended)
# Technical Implementation
# Core Components
# 1.	Data Preprocessing
#  	- StandardScaler for feature scaling
# - PolynomialFeatures for feature engineering
# - SelectKBest for feature selection
# 2.	Model Implementations
# –	Base Models:
# •	Linear Regression
# •	Ridge Regression
# •	Lasso Regression
# •	ElasticNet
# •	Random Forest
# 3.	Optimization Pipeline
#  	Data Loading → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Selection → Hyperparameter Tuning → Evaluation
# Model Optimization Methods
# 1. Feature Scaling
# •	Standardizes features to mean=0 and variance=1
# •	Improves model convergence
# •	Essential for distance-based algorithms
# 2. Polynomial Features
# •	Creates interaction terms
# •	Captures non-linear relationships
# •	Degree=2 polynomial transformations
# 3. Feature Selection
# •	Uses f_regression for scoring
# •	Selects top K features
# •	Reduces model complexity
# 4. Algorithm Selection
# Algorithm	Strength	Use Case
# Linear Regression	Baseline	Simple linear relationships
# 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
# •	Grid Search Cross-validation
# •	Optimized parameters per algorithm
# •	K-fold validation (k=5)
# Usage Instructions
# Basic Usage
# 1.	Prepare your data:
#  	# Ensure your CSV file is in the correct format
# df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
# 2.	Run the model:
#  	
# python main.py
# Advanced Usage
# 
# param_grid = {
#     'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
#     'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
#     'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
# }
# 
# 
# cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
# Output Interpretation
# Model Performance Metrics
# •	RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
# –	Lower is better
# –	Same units as target variable
# •	R² Score
# –	Range: 0 to 1
# –	Higher is better
# Visualization Outputs
# 1.	Performance Comparison Plot
# –	Bar chart of RMSE values
# –	Compare different models
# 2.	Feature Importance Plot
# –	Bar chart of feature weights
# –	Identifies key predictors
# Troubleshooting
# Common Issues
# 1.	FileNotFoundError
# –	Solution: Ensure ‘data.csv’ is in the correct directory
# 2.	ValueError: Missing required columns
# –	Solution: Check CSV file format matches requirements
# 3.	Memory Issues
# –	Solution: Reduce polynomial feature degree
# –	Solution: Decrease cross-validation folds
# Error Messages
# try:
#     # Your code
# except FileNotFoundError:
#     print("Error: CSV file not found")
# except ValueError as e:
#     print(f"Error in data: {e}")
